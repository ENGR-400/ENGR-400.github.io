# Abstract

The barriers to create electronics have never been lower.  With a computer, an internet connection, a credit card, and a few hundred bucks, anyone could get started creating electronics.  Business folks want electronics in everything, but they don't necessarily want to staff engineers.  This creates an market opportunity for designing electronics at a very small organizational scale--even as a "side hustle"!  In this talk, we discuss modern electronics design services, changes over the past ten years, and look to the future.
