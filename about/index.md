# About Enginerdery

Enginerdery (an [openENGR](http://www.openengr.com) project) is a blog which provides an outlet for engineering researchers and scholars to share their work with a broad audience. Too often the research community becomes insular and neglectful of the public audience in our research dissemination.

Researchers and scholars across all of engineering are invited to submit a plain English write up of their recent paper or other published work written with the general public in mind.

Please see our [submission instructions](http://www.enginerdery.org/submit/) to get started.
