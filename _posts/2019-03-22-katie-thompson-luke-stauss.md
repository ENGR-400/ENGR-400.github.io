# Abstract

Product development is often seen and demonstrated in a clear, linear, clean process, with the mythical one right solution that wins out at the end.  However, truth be told – product development isn’t always clean and easy, and sometimes the consumer experience does not match data.  With the development process both qualitative and quantitative analysis plays important and sometimes counterintuitive roles in the process.  Within this talk we will learn how Industrial Designers and Engineers balance the need and usage of qualitative and quantitative testing tools in order to achieve the final solution.
