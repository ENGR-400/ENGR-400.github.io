# Abstract

Accurate simulations of combustion and reacting fluid flows require complex, multi-step chemical kinetic models for describing the coupled chemical reactions. These models are often large and mathematically stiff, and contribute to the overall high computational expense of simulating practical phenomena relevant to energy, transportation, and aerospace applications. This talk will discuss these issues, and review work the Niemeyer Research Group has done to tackle these and related problems.

# Bio

Dr. Kyle Niemeyer is an Associate Professor in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University.
