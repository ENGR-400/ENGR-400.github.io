# Abstract

The barriers to creating electronics have never been lower. With a computer, an internet connection, a credit card, and a few hundred bucks, anyone can get started creating electronics.  Business folks want electronics in everything, but they don't necessarily want to staff engineers. This creates a market opportunity for designing electronics at a very small organizational scale--even as a "side hustle"!  In this talk, we discuss modern electronics design services, changes over the past ten years, and look to the future.

# Bio
