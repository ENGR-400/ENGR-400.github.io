# Abstract

Since 2016, Atlas has been changing the idea of what robots can do with YouTube hits such as “[What’s new, Atlas?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRj34o4hN4I)”, where it backflipped its way to 19M views, as well as showcasing its latest dance moves in “[Do You Love Me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw)”. Tune in to this talk to get a glimpse into the mechanical design workflow and key ingredients that have enabled turning science fiction into hardware reality.

# Bio

Haink is a Senior Mechanical Engineer at Boston Dynamics and a Big 10 graduate (BS PSU, PhD UMN). The most recent version of Atlas, filmed in “[Do You Love Me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw)”, features several of Haink’s designs (rugged battery, 5-DOF pelvis, hydraulic power unit, printed manifolds). Haink values creative design and looks for ways to use simple geometry to perform multiple functions.
